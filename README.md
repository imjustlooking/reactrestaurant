# Introduction

A dummy restaurant site.

It was meant to be a mini project for me to get more familiar with React. I've used a bit of state handling, using react router (anchor tags), and react scrollchor ( same page scrolling anchor tags).

If you would like to git clone this and run it locally, please follow the simple steps below.

1. Install the package modules:
```
yarn install
```
2. Start the project
```
yarn start
```


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
